# cointoss_experiment
Modeled stochastic experiments with Python. The following two programs simulate the toss of a fair coin N times, and calculate the experimental probability of getting heads (p_heads) or tails (p_heads). Both programs provide the same results, but they differ in the way the models are coded. The first model is programmed in Python using "for loops". The second model makes use of the array
